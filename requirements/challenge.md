# Frontend Challenge Checklist: Online Bookstore

## Requirements

- [ ] **Pages and Navigation:**
  - [ ] Create pages for:
    - [ ] Home (list of featured books)
    - [ ] Book Details (view details of a selected book)
    - [ ] Cart (view items in the cart and manage quantities)
    - [ ] Authentication (login, signup, logout)
    - [ ] Order History (view past orders)
  - [ ] Implement client-side routing using Next.js for smooth navigation between pages.

- [ ] **User Interface:**
  - [ ] Design responsive and intuitive UI using components.
  - [ ] Use a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS for styling.
  - [ ] Implement forms for login, signup, and updating user information.
  - [ ] Display books in a grid or list format with images, titles, authors, and prices.
  - [ ] Provide feedback to users (e.g., success messages, error alerts).

- [ ] **State Management:**
  - [ ] Manage global state using React Context API or a state management library (e.g., Redux, Zustand).
  - [ ] Store user authentication status and user information securely.
  - [ ] Manage cart state to add, update, and remove items.

- [ ] **Authentication and Authorization:**
  - [ ] Implement authentication using JWT tokens.
  - [ ] Secure routes for authenticated users only (e.g., cart, order history).
  - [ ] Provide login and signup forms with validation.

- [ ] **API Integration:**
  - [ ] Fetch data from the backend API (mock API endpoints or real if available).
  - [ ] Handle asynchronous actions using `fetch` API or Axios.
  - [ ] Display book details dynamically based on user selection.
  - [ ] Implement actions like adding/removing items from the cart.

- [ ] **Type Safety:**
  - [ ] Use TypeScript for type safety throughout the application.
  - [ ] Define interfaces for API responses, form data, and state structures.

- [ ] **Testing:**
  - [ ] Write unit tests for critical components and utility functions using Jest or React Testing Library.
  - [ ] Test user interactions, API calls, and state changes.

## Evaluation Criteria

- [ ] **UI/UX Design:**

  - [ ] Navigation is intuitive and user-friendly.

- [ ] **State Management:**
  - [ ] Global state is managed efficiently with clear separation of concerns.
  - [ ] Data flows correctly between components.

- [ ] **Authentication and Authorization:**

  - [ ] Errors are handled gracefully with clear messages.

- [ ] **Code Quality:**
  - [ ] Code is well-structured, modular, and follows best practices.
  - [ ] TypeScript is used effectively for type safety and code readability.

- [ ] **Testing Coverage:**

## Notes

- Adjust the checklist based on project requirements and available resources.
- Aim for a balance between feature completeness and quality of implementation.
- Use mock data or a sandbox environment for backend interactions if necessary.
